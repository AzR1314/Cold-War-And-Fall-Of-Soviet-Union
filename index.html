            <div class="content">
                <p>The Soviet economy stagnated in the 1970s due to inefficiencies in central planning and an over-reliance on oil exports, which masked deeper structural problems. The Soviet-Afghan War (1979–1989) marked a turning point, costing billions and over 15,000 Soviet lives, draining resources, and lowering morale. This period highlighted the USSR’s inability to sustain its superpower status, setting the stage for its eventual collapse.</p>

            <h2>1969–1980: U.S. Policy of Détente</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Détente reduced the risk of nuclear war but didn’t halt Soviet internal struggles, as economic dependence on the West grew.</p>

                <div class="extra-info">
                    <p>So, détente was this big deal where the U.S. tried to chill out the Cold War with the Soviet Union. It started around 1969 when both sides were like, “Hey, let’s not blow up the world, okay?” One of the coolest things was the SALT I treaty in 1972—it was all about limiting nuclear weapons so neither side could just nuke the other out of nowhere. Nixon even went to Moscow that year, which was huge because no U.S. president had done that before during the Cold War. They also started trading stuff, like the U.S. sending grain to the Soviets because their economy was kind of a mess. It was a pretty peaceful time for a bit, like a break from all the tension. But then the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, and Reagan came in with his tough-guy attitude in the 1980s, so détente fell apart. It showed how weak the Soviets were getting—they needed our help just to keep going!</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Gorbachev came in and tried to fix the Soviet Union with some big changes, but it ended up making everything fall apart faster.</p>

                <div class="extra-info">
                    <p>Alright, so when Mikhail Gorbachev became the Soviet leader in 1985, he saw how messed up everything was—like, the economy was stuck, and people were tired of the same old communist stuff. He started this thing called <em>perestroika</em>, which was supposed to shake up the economy by letting people do more business on their own, kind of like mini-capitalism. Then there was <em>glasnost</em>, which means openness, and it let people say what they really thought without getting in trouble. Cool, right? But it backfired big time. By 1989, the economy was dropping like 4% a year because no one knew how to handle the changes, and all that free speech just made people mad at the government. Gorbachev wanted to keep the Soviet Union together, but his ideas accidentally let places like Ukraine and the Baltics start pushing to leave. It was a total mess, and by 1991, the whole thing just collapsed!</p>

            <h2>1989–1991: Velvet Revolutions & Nationalism</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In 1989, Eastern Europe started breaking free from Soviet control super peacefully, and it kicked off a huge wave of countries wanting out.</p>
                <button class="expand-btn">Learn More</button>
                <div class="extra-info">
                    <p>So, 1989 was this crazy year where everything changed in Eastern Europe, and it was called the Velvet Revolutions because it was mostly chill, no big wars or anything. Like, Poland had these talks with Solidarity—a group of workers who were done with Soviet rules—and they actually got to hold free elections, which was wild! Hungary opened its borders, letting people escape to the West, and Czechoslovakia had protests that just ended communism there without any fighting. It all started because Gorbachev said he wouldn’t stop them, which was a huge deal. Then, inside the Soviet Union, places like Lithuania and others saw this and were like, “We want out too!” By 1991, over 15 republics had split off. It was like the Soviet Union was falling apart piece by piece, and everyone was just ready to be their own boss!</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>The Berlin Wall’s fall on November 9, 1989, symbolized the Cold War’s end, driven by East German protests and Gorbachev’s refusal to intervene. The USSR dissolved on December 26, 1991, after a failed coup against Gorbachev, leaving the U.S. as the sole superpower and ending decades of ideological rivalry.</p>
