            <div class="content">
                <p>The Soviet economy stagnated in the 1970s due to inefficiencies in central planning and an over-reliance on oil exports, which masked deeper structural problems. The Soviet-Afghan War (1979–1989) marked a turning point, costing billions and over 15,000 Soviet lives, draining resources, and lowering morale. This period highlighted the USSR’s inability to sustain its superpower status, setting the stage for its eventual collapse.</p>

            <h2>1969–1980: U.S. Policy of Détente</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Détente reduced the risk of nuclear war but didn’t halt Soviet internal struggles, as economic dependence on the West grew.</p>

                <div class="extra-info">The U.S. pursued détente to reduce Cold War tensions, exemplified by the 1972 SALT I treaty limiting nuclear arms and Nixon’s historic 1972 Moscow visit. This era saw trade deals (e.g., U.S. grain exports) and a temporary thaw, but it ended with Reagan’s aggressive stance in the 1980s, spurred by Soviet actions like the Afghan invasion. Détente showed the USSR’s economic fragility as it relied on Western aid.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Mikhail Gorbachev’s <em>perestroika</em> (restructuring) aimed to modernize the economy by introducing market elements, while <em>glasnost</em> (openness) encouraged free speech to expose corruption. Instead, these reforms unleashed chaos—economic output fell 4% annually by 1989, and public dissent grew, weakening the Communist Party’s grip and hastening the USSR’s disintegration.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>The rise of nationalism fueled independence demands across the USSR, with over 15 republics breaking away by 1991.</p>

                <div class="extra-info">The “Velvet Revolutions” saw Eastern Bloc nations like Poland (Solidarity movement) and Czechoslovakia overthrow Soviet control peacefully in 1989, inspired by Gorbachev’s reforms. Simultaneously, nationalist movements in Soviet republics—e.g., Lithuania’s 1990 independence declaration—fractured the USSR, as ethnic groups demanded sovereignty, signaling the end of centralized power.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <p>The Berlin Wall’s fall on November 9, 1989, symbolized the Cold War’s end, driven by East German protests and Gorbachev’s refusal to intervene. The USSR dissolved on December 26, 1991, after a failed coup against Gorbachev, leaving the U.S. as the sole superpower and ending decades of ideological rivalry.</p>
