            <h2>1970–1980: Soviet Economy and Afghanistan</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>By the 1970s, the Soviet economy entered a period of stagnation, known as the "Era of Stagnation" under Leonid Brezhnev, due to inefficiencies in its centrally planned system and an over-reliance on oil and gas exports, which accounted for over 50% of its hard currency earnings by 1975. This masked deeper issues like declining agricultural output (grain production fell 10% from 1965–1975) and outdated industrial technology. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 escalated these problems, costing an estimated $2–3 billion annually and over 15,000 Soviet lives by 1989. The war drained resources, fueled domestic discontent (e.g., rising alcoholism rates), and damaged the USSR’s international reputation, accelerating its economic and political decline.</p>

                <div class="extra-info">The U.S. adopted détente in the late 1960s to ease Cold War tensions, driven by President Richard Nixon and advisor Henry Kissinger after the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) underscored nuclear risks. Key achievements included the 1972 Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I), freezing ICBM numbers at 1,054 for the USSR and 1,000 for the U.S., and Nixon’s May 1972 Moscow visit—the first by a U.S. president—yielding trade agreements like $750 million in U.S. grain sales to the USSR in 1973. Détente peaked with the Helsinki Accords (1975), recognizing post-WWII borders, but unraveled after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979), prompting President Jimmy Carter’s grain embargo and Ronald Reagan’s hardline shift in 1981. This period exposed Soviet economic weaknesses, as it leaned on Western imports to offset domestic shortages.</div>

            <h2>1985–1991: Gorbachev’s Reforms</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in March 1985, inheriting a stagnant economy and a rigid political system. His <em>perestroika</em> (restructuring) introduced limited market reforms, like the 1987 Law on State Enterprise allowing factories to set prices, aiming to boost efficiency. <em>Glasnost</em> (openness) permitted media criticism, exposing disasters like Chernobyl (1986) and corruption, with over 300 banned books published by 1989. However, these reforms backfired: GDP shrank 4% yearly by 1989, inflation soared to 10%, and food shortages sparked strikes (e.g., 1989 coal miners’ strike). Political openness fueled dissent, weakening the Communist Party and paving the way for the USSR’s collapse.</p>

                <div class="extra-info">The “Velvet Revolutions” of 1989 saw Eastern Bloc countries break free from Soviet control, catalyzed by Gorbachev’s non-intervention policy. Poland’s Solidarity movement, led by Lech Wałęsa, won free elections in June 1989, ending 45 years of communist rule; Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution in November 1989 ousted its regime in 11 days via mass protests. Concurrently, nationalism surged within the USSR: Lithuania declared independence in March 1990, followed by Latvia and Estonia, with violent clashes (e.g., 13 deaths in Vilnius, 1991). These movements, rooted in decades of suppressed identity under Stalin’s forced Russification, eroded Moscow’s authority, fracturing the Soviet Union into 15 republics by 1991.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <p>The Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989, after weeks of protests in East Germany (e.g., 500,000 in Leipzig, October 1989) and Hungary’s border opening, with Gorbachev refusing military support—unlike 1953 or 1968. This symbolized the Cold War’s end, followed by Germany’s reunification in October 1990. The USSR faced its final blow in August 1991 when a hardliner coup against Gorbachev failed, accelerating the dissolution. On December 26, 1991, the Soviet flag was lowered over the Kremlin, replaced by Russia’s, as 15 republics emerged, ending a 69-year superpower rivalry and leaving the U.S. dominant.</p>
