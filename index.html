                    <p>The Soviet economy stagnated in the 1970s due to inefficiencies in central planning and an over-reliance on oil exports, which masked deeper structural problems. The Soviet-Afghan War (1979–1989) marked a turning point, costing billions and over 15,000 Soviet lives, draining resources, and lowering morale. This period highlighted the USSR’s inability to sustain its superpower status, setting the stage for its eventual collapse.</p>

                        <p>The United States initiated a policy of détente with the Soviet Union beginning in 1969 to reduce Cold War tensions. This effort aimed to prevent nuclear conflict and foster diplomatic engagement. A significant achievement was the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) treaty, signed in 1972, which restricted the development of nuclear weapons. That same year, President Nixon’s visit to Moscow marked a historic milestone, being the first by a U.S. president during the Cold War. Economic cooperation also emerged, with the United States exporting grain to address Soviet agricultural shortages. This period of détente offered a temporary respite from hostilities. However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 prompted a shift in U.S. policy under President Reagan, who adopted a more assertive stance in the 1980s, ending détente. This era revealed the Soviet Union’s increasing reliance on Western support amid its economic difficulties.</p>

                        <p>Upon assuming leadership in 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev recognized the Soviet Union’s economic stagnation and systemic inefficiencies. He introduced <em>perestroika</em>, a policy aimed at restructuring the economy by incorporating limited market mechanisms and reducing state control. Additionally, he enacted <em>glasnost</em>, a policy of openness that permitted greater freedom of expression and criticism of the government. Initially, these reforms were intended to strengthen the Soviet system. By 1989, however, the economy had declined approximately 4% annually due to the disruption caused by these changes. The increased freedom of speech fueled public discontent and demands for autonomy in regions such as Ukraine and the Baltic states. Gorbachev aimed to preserve the unity of the Soviet Union, yet his policies ultimately contributed to its disintegration by 1991.</p>

                    <div class="extra-info">
                        <p>The year 1989 marked a significant turning point in Eastern Europe, characterized by a series of nonviolent transitions known as the Velvet Revolutions. In Poland, negotiations between the communist government and the Solidarity trade union resulted in free elections, effectively ending Soviet-aligned governance. Hungary facilitated this shift by opening its borders to Western Europe, enabling thousands to emigrate from Soviet influence. Czechoslovakia experienced a rapid transition through organized protests, leading to the replacement of its communist leadership with minimal conflict. These developments were possible due to Gorbachev’s decision to refrain from military intervention, a departure from previous Soviet policy. Within the Soviet Union, these events encouraged regions such as Lithuania to pursue independence, with formal declarations beginning in 1990. By 1991, more than 15 republics had seceded, driven by the example of Eastern Europe’s success and growing nationalist sentiment, ultimately contributing to the Soviet Union’s collapse.</p>

                        <p>The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was the culmination of several interconnected events from the preceding decades. Economic stagnation and the costly Soviet-Afghan War during the 1970s and 1980s, as detailed in the first event, weakened the USSR’s financial stability and global standing. The policy of détente with the United States, initiated in 1969, exposed Soviet economic vulnerabilities through increased reliance on Western trade, as outlined in the second event. Gorbachev’s reforms of <em>perestroika</em> and <em>glasnost</em>, introduced in 1985, destabilized the Soviet system by encouraging dissent and regional autonomy, as described in the third event. The Velvet Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe, followed by nationalist movements within the USSR, eroded Soviet authority as over 15 republics pursued independence, as noted in the fourth event. The final catalyst came with Gorbachev’s decision to allow elections with a multi-party system and create a presidency for the Soviet Union. This began a slow process of democratization that eventually destabilized Communist control and contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Following the May 1990 elections, Gorbachev faced conflicting internal political pressures: Boris Yeltsin and the pluralist movement advocated democratization and rapid economic reforms, while the hard-line Communist elite sought to thwart Gorbachev’s reform agenda. These tensions culminated in the failed coup of August 1991, which precipitated the USSR’s dissolution by December of that year.</p>

                    <p>In 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) initiated investigations into alleged communist influence in Hollywood, fearing subversive propaganda in films. Over nine days in October, HUAC subpoenaed 43 witnesses, including screenwriters and directors. Ten, known as the “Hollywood Ten,” refused to testify, citing First Amendment rights, and were cited for contempt, jailed for up to a year, and blacklisted. By 1950, over 300 artists faced career ruin, setting a precedent for fear-driven anti-communist tactics that pressured individuals to name associates or face social and economic ostracism.</p>

                    <p>On February 9, 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed in Wheeling, West Virginia, to hold a list of 205 communists in the State Department, later revised to 57, asserting, “The State Department is infested with communists” (McCarthy, 1950). Lacking evidence, his speech exploited Cold War anxieties and early Venona findings of Soviet espionage, igniting public panic. This launched McCarthy’s crusade, leading to investigations that often targeted innocent individuals without due process, amplifying the internal communist fear.</p>

By 1948, decryptions identified over 100 Soviet agents in the U.S., confirming infiltration (Haynes & Klehr, 1999). Its secrecy meant HUAC and McCarthy relied on unverified accusations, escalating fear. Declassified in 1995, Venona validated some concerns but exposed the overreach of anti-communist campaigns that lacked public evidence.</p>

                        <p>HUAC’s 1947 hearings blacklisted the Hollywood Ten, setting a fear-driven precedent. McCarthy’s 1950 speech, claiming widespread infiltration, amplified panic, fueled by Venona’s secret evidence of 100+ agents. McCarthyism’s peak saw 2,000+ government dismissals and 300+ blacklisted artists, often without proof. The 1954 censure and HUAC’s 1975 dissolution rejected such tactics, but Venona’s 1995 declassification confirmed some threats, highlighting the ethical cost of fanaticism in a democracy.</p>
